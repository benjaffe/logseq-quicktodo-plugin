# Overview

This simple plugin helps you to insert a TODO item on your today's journal page, without navigating to it. This maybe useful when you are writing notes on one page, and suddenly want to add a task item regarding a separate matter. Instead of going to your daily page and adding the task there, this plugin allows you to add it using the command palatte.

Supports most date formats with 'dd', 'MM', 'yyyy', 'do', 'MMM', 'MMMM'.

# Installation

Please install from the marketplace. If it's not available there, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-quicktodo-plugin/releases), unzip the file and manually load it into Logseq.

# Usage

To begin, just activate the command palatte (Win: `Ctrl + Shift + p`, Mac: `Cmd + Shift + p`) and type `quick`, and the option `Quick todo to today's journal page` will appear. Select it and you can start keying in your task, and pressing `Enter` after. Your task will then appear on today's journal page.
